## What is Tiny Massive?

This project is very infant. This is an experiment to run the state of an MMO style server inside of redis. Looking to the future I would like to incorporate redis cluster to manage multiple servers.

**TinyMassive.js** is the framework.

**ThereCanOnlyBeOne.js** is a sample implementation of Tiny Massive. I'm still in a experimental phase where certain things move from the implementation to framework side and vice versa.
